            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>DOctor <hi>John Hewit</hi> being apprehended for a Conſpirator againſt the preſent Power and Authority, was on Tueſday the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> brought before the high Court of Juſtice, to anſwer to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement of high Treaſon, then and there exhibited againſt him, his Plea being demanded, he moved the Court not to reſpect his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but to excuſe it, leaſt taking advantages by the niceties of the Laws, they might bereave him of thoſe benefits the Law allowed him, or over-power his Innocency; This was not denyed, but his requeſt reaching farther to deſire to hear the Commiſſion of the Court read, which he alledged was reaſonable, and that he conceived it to be his juſt right to know the validity of that Authority by which they ſat, and whether according to Law they were Compitent Judges in his Caſe; further urging that thoſe being matters of Law, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired to have the liberty to adviſe with Councel in theſe and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43925:3"/>other the like Cauſe which did highly concern him; this being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, he urged further that he conceived it to be his right, as an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> to be tryed by a Jury, and the Judges of his Highneſſe Corts to whom and to the common Law he did appeale, but being could there could, be no appeale from them to any Court, except to a Parliament, becauſe no other Court is above them; All thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences to the Judges of the Courts of Judicature, or to his Highneſſe Councel againſt that, if they or any of them would give it under their hand that his Tryall was according to Law, he would ſubmit, but that not being granted, as tending to the diſhonour of that Court to appeale to any other Court or Perſons, the Dr. declared how in his owne opinion he ſtood bound in conſcience and duty not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to that power (meaning the Court) of whoſe Authority accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law he was not convinced, his not pleading being recorded upon his default, he was taken from the Bar, where on <hi>June</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. lie received his Sentence as a Traitor, to be hanged drawne and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, which he received without the leaſt dejection of ſpirit.</p>

The time drawing near of his death, which was Saturday <hi>June</hi> the fifth, the Sentence was altered, his head being to be ſevered from his Body, on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> on Tueſday the eigh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h of the ſame Moneth? The Lords day he implyed for the moſt part in earneſt ſeeking God by prayer, that ſo through thoſe ſorrows and teares, he might purchaſe the fruition of joys and pleaſures, moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, pure and perpetuall; The reſt of the day being the afternoon, he paſt away in diſcourſe with ſome friends, who came to condole his condition, who deported himſelfe with that chearfullneſſe, that they nor he need to metigate ſorrow, and as the feare of death was not tedious to him to imbraſe, charity bids us conclude he did it to put on a better Life; This afternoon too paſſages are obſerveable.</p>
               <p>The firſt, whil'ſt the Doctor was diſcourſeing with ſome Friends, a Woman got accidentally to his Chamber doore, and in a ſeeming mallincollineſſe drew neare him, and laid her hat at his Feet, ſaying, I can never be at quiet when the godly are to ſuffer. The next, the Gard being releived, he turned to them that were departing, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43925:3"/>with a chearfull deportment and humble carriage, ſaith <hi>faire well my deare friends,</hi> and in all this time ſeemed ſo little to be moved at his Impriſonment, that as the walls confinde his body, ſo meekneſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned his paſſions. On munday morning his Lady came to viſit him, but with how little pleaſure or content, I leave it to them ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, who contemplatively can make her ſorrow their one, now ſhe muſt not onely take her leave for a day, but reſolve to ſee him no more in the fleſh, and indeed to me it ſeemes impoſſible to diſtinguiſh, which was the greateſt weight of ſorrow to her ſpirit, that he muſt ſuffer an untimely death, and be no more, or that ſhe muſt take her laſt farewell of him, and ſo ſhe have him dead to her whil'ſt alive, but ſince providence compels them to part here, Imagen, for I cannot expreſſe their affectionate farewels with teares, till they meet where joys are compleater &amp; perpetual; This being paſt, he makes it his only work to put of this, and to prepare for a better life, in which D. <hi>Wild</hi> added to his indeavours his pious aſſiſtance, the day being ſpent, Dr. <hi>Wilde</hi> left him not without the beames and light of a friends <hi>prayers,</hi> and the dayes glory together, but kept him company all that night, thereby to make day in his ſoule, thought it were night in the World. (Immediately after came Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carill,</hi> Mr. <hi>Manton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bates,</hi> and others, with whoſe diſcourſe they were ſo affected, that that evening they took Coach on <hi>Lud-gate</hi> Hill, and went down to white-Hall to beg his life of his Highneſſe the Lord <hi>Protector,</hi> but that were not granted.)</p>

               </gap>ether it were a Church, or no? I ſay, It was mode purely Divine and Apoſtolical, than any other Doctrine or Church in the Chriſtian World, whether National, or Claſtical, or Congregational: And I muſt tell you, That as I am a member of this Church, ſo I am a member of the holy Catholique Church, and ſhall give a moſt juſt confeſſion of my faith, both negatively and affirmatively. Negatively, I am ſo a member of the holy Catholique Church, that I abhor all <hi>Secis, Schiſms, Sedition,</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> Affirmatively ſo, That as I hold communion with, ſo I love and honour all Chriſtians in the world, that love the ſame Lord JESUS in ſincerity, and call on his Name, agreeing with thoſe truths that are abſolutely neceſſary and clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in the word of God, both in the Old and New Teſtament, though in charily diſſenting from ſome others that are not neceſſary. And I, as I am thus a Chriſtian, I hope for ſalvation through the merits of Chriſt JESUS, his blood I rely on, his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits I truſt to for the ſalvation of my own ſoul; though to this Faith good Works are neceſſary, not meritorious in us, but onely made meritorious by Chriſt his death, by his all-ſufficiency, by his ſatisfaction, and his righteouſneſſe, they become meritorious, but in us they are no other than as deſired rags. And truly, as I am a man be of the Church, ſo I told you, I was a member of this Community, and ſo pleaded ſo the Liberties and Priviledges thereof. In muſt now anſwer ſomthing I am aſperſed withall in the World.</p>
            <p>They talk of ſomthing of a Plot, and a Treaſonable deſigne, and that I had a great intereſt in the knowledge and practiſe thereof; and that, for the ſaving my life, I would have diſcovered and betrayed I cannot toll what.

It is ſaid likewiſe, I entertained the Earl, the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond:</hi> To my remembrance I never ſaw the face of that honourable Perſon in my life. It is ſaid, One Lords day I did preach at Saint <hi>Gregories,</hi> and the next Lords day I was at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> or <hi>Bruges,</hi> and kiſt the Kings hand, and brought I cannot tell what Orders and Inſtructions from him. This I ſhall ſay, For theſe three years laſt paſt together, I have not been ſixty miles from this City of <hi>London,</hi> and I think it is ſomewhat further to either of thoſe places, than threeſcore miles. It is ſaid that I kept correſpondence with one <hi>Mallory</hi> and <hi>Biſhop:</hi> They are perſons I have heard of their names, but never in all my life to my knowledge ſaw their faces; and to my knowledge I doe not know they know me; nor doe I know them at all, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I have heard of their names. And whoſoever elſe hath ſuggeſted ſuch things againſt me, I know not, but the Lord God forgive them, who is juſt and mercifull.</p>

Here truly I do ſay, and have it from many of thoſe that are Judges of the High Court, by which I was condemned, that upon examination of the buſineſs they have not found me a med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler at all in theſe affaires. And truly I muſt needs ſay therefore, That it was a very uncharitable act in them (who ever they were) that brought ſuch accuſation againſt me, and irritated his Highneſſe againſt me, which firſt obſtructed my liberty, next brought to the Bar as a Traitor, which now commands me to ſatisfie them with my blood, but I will not ſay it was malice, it might be zeal, but it was raſh zeal which cauſed me to be ſentenced to this place: The God of Mercy pardon and forgive them all. And truly, as I am a member of the Church, and as a member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, where on behalfe I have been ſpeaking, I cannot but doe as our Saviour himſelfe did for his Diſciples, when he was to be taken from them, he bleſſed them, and aſcended up to Heaven.
